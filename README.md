## Results of the project

Results and discussion were published on Medium: [Machine learning can predict whether a customer is happy or not](https://medium.com/@ericnguifo/machine-learning-can-predict-whether-a-customer-is-happy-or-not-7037f8761b6d)
The results can be summarized as follows:
- The project is about predicting whether the customers of a business will be happy or not with the business’s product.To illustrate that, we used the dataset Santader released on kaggle.
- Some data visualizations was done and showed for example that unhappy customers used less products.
- Some data processing was done and clustering was also implemented to group data with similar features.
- Machine learning was then used to predict customer’s satisfaction where an auc of 0.841805 was obtained.
The top 20 features relevant to prediction was then displayed.
